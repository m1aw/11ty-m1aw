I'm Ant√≥nio, a front-end software developer with almost 5 years of experience, and I'm currently living in **Utrecht, the Netherlands**.

Originally I'm from Porto, Portugal where I graduated from ISEP, in Informatics/Software Engineering while working for a startup developing mobile apps in **Typescript**, **Angular** and Ionic for the country biggest retailer.

Moved to **the Netherlands** more than 1 and a half year ago, to work for **Dept Technology** and digital agency where I was focused on doing e-commerce solutions for very large customers, using the latest Frontend technologies such as **React**, **Vue**, **Typescript** and SSR (**Next** and **Nuxt**).

I have several side projects but my most recent one is [growthmind.club](https://growthmind.club), where I want to help people come together to be learn and be accountable.
